<h2> idea of Autoiling element and element in my design</h2>
<h3>Share Idea: From Classmate "Tei Hek" and Thanks for his advice!
<li>let tile = noise(i, j)...;</li>
<li>// Adjacent tiles</li>
<li>let left = noise(i - 1, j)...;</li>
<li>let right = noise(i + 1, j)...;</li>
<li>let up = noise(i, j - 1)...;</li>
<li>let down = noise(i, j + 1)...;</li>
</h3>

<h3>Element</h3>
<li>First Lava and hell forest's boundary will show the lava burn some of the hell grass, which you can see some hole.</li>
<li>The Tomb around the lava also will have the hole around it, also when user click Tomb to new picture, I also create a floor cracks with lava for autotile the lava and tomb.</li>

<h2>The interactivity inside my design:</h2>
<li>When user clicking on the lava, the lava will add a flying ghost.</li>
<li>When user clicking on the hell grass, the hell tree will show up on the hell grass ground, also there will be some yellow flower(dot) around the tree.</li>
<li>When user clicking on the tomb, the tomb will be "destory"(remove and have a new picture), and user will see a floor cracks with lava.</li>

<h3>Artist statement: What is the effect you're trying to achieve? Did you achieve that effect? If not, what was the difficulty/limitation with tools, and what did you end up doing?</h3>
